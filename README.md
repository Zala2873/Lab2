Overview of Project
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset was used to train machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer tumors. The models use cell nucleus properties from digital pictures of a breast mass's fine needle aspirate (FNA) to identify malignant from benign tumors.

Models
The models were built using two algorithms:

Logistic Regression Model (model_v1): Logistic regression is efficient and simple in binary classification jobs.
SVM Model (model_v2): Classification is done using a linear kernel Support Vector Machine. SVMs work well in high-dimensional spaces and resist overfitting.
Dataset
The dataset is at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The cell nuclei's radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave spots, symmetry, and fractal dimension are inclu
